Repost interested tweets to Sina Weibo.

There is an ignored file `appconfig.py` which list some private information related to Weibo and Twitter app settings. It looks like:

```py
t_consumer_key = 'xxx'
t_consumer_secret = 'xxx'
t_access_token = 'xxx'
t_access_token_secret = 'xxx'

w_api_key = 'xxx'
w_api_secret = 'xxx'
w_redirect_uri = 'xxx'
w_token = 'xxx'

# Reposted Twitter user IDs
twitter_ids = ['xxx', 'xxx']

```
